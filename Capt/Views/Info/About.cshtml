<h2>About @ViewBag.SiteName</h2>

<p>
    @ViewBag.SiteName is a website where new images are posted at regular intervals, for which users are invited to supply captions.
    The idea was <strike>ripped off from</strike> inspired by <a href="http://www.spinnwebe.com/">SpinnWebe</a>'s
    sadly-defunct <a href="http://www.spinnwebe.com/iadl/">It's a Dysfunctional Life</a>.
</p>

<p>
    @ViewBag.SiteName only uses photos whose authors have licensed them for use by others. If you find your photo here and would 
    rather it weren't, please @Html.ActionLink("contact " + ViewData["SiteName"], "Contact", "Info") to have it removed.
</p>

<p>
    @ViewBag.SiteName is supposed to be fun.
